\chapter{Cost estimation}%
\label{chap:costEstimation}
Our plans made sure to keep into account all possible costs that our team will incur during development. As such we planned to recruit new team members only when needed in order to keep costs as low as possible. Our first research phase won’t be very expensive and it will be mainly led by our core team. The main source of cost will be the recruitment of new team members as well as the planning and launching of the marketing campaign in order to ensure a successful launch, which we think is paramount to the long term success of the entire project.
Technology wise the infrastructure won’t have a great cost in the development and beta phase and we plan to scale according to the demand, in such a way we can be sure to avoid scaling over the demanded size and use the budget for possible extensions of the product or improving upon the existing services offered.\\
