\label{chap:introduction}
The goal of this document is to collect and explain the choices, possibilities and motivations of the mobile application AlGa, developed by Alessandro Falcetta and Gabriele Guelfi.

AlGa is an Android application developed within the course of \textit{Design and Implementation of Mobile Applications} ad Politecnico di Milano, Italy. The goal of this course is to design a ``mobile''applications by considering both the problem of designing the user experience, that is, the screens used to interact with the user, and the problem of understanding the actual distribution of the components that constitute the application and their interactions.

The document is organized as follows: Chapter~\ref{chap:ideaAndRequirements} states what the app is about and which are the requirement is must satisfy. Chapter~\ref{chap:implementationChoices} explains the reasons behind the choice of the used technologies. Chapter~\ref{chap:architecture} details the architectural choices for the entire application, while Chapter~\ref{chap:userInterface} gives an overview on the application from the point of view of the user, including some screenshots and mock-ups. Chapter~\ref{chap:externalServices} explains the use of external APIs, while some business-driven considerations are proposed in Chapter~\ref{chap:costEstimation}. Conclusions are finally drawn in Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusions}.
